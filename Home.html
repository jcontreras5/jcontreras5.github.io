      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p> My name is Jonathan Contreras. I was born and currently reside in Chicago ,Illinois. I am a twenty eight year old Mexican American male.I am a first generation from my family to be born in the US. I was coincidentally born on Easter on my birth year. I have always lived in Chicago except for a one month stint living in Dallas that backfired.</p>
      <p>I was pursuing a Mechanical Engineering degree at UIC before I left that to take on a fork in my life road to take on a full time position in the Information Technology sector again. 
        I would have graduated by now if I would have continued. I went to a highshcool that had a work study program so I have always been exposed to Corporate environments in different sectors ranging from healthcare, finance, IT, and the sports indurstry.</p>
      <p>I currently work as a data center field technician for Akamai Technologies, Inc. I have always worked in the Information Technology sector as a young adult. During the pandemic, I realized I didn't want to continue climbing up the ladder in the company I was working for doing what I do.The climb would just be based on seniority and not based on productivity or skill.  I was no longer being challenged or learning anything new even after asking porject managers for opportunities to do so. In my opinion, I was seeing my job as a pigeon hold and a dead end the more I stayed in. </p>
      <p> This is where Coding Temple came into my sights. I started researching parallel moves within the industry to try my hand at something I've always had a curiosity for. I do have some very basic background in HTML,CSS,Bootstrap and some Python but purely in an academic context from College. I've always wanted to see what else I could personally achieve with coding professionally and personally. I hope to increase my skill library with the opportunity that is Coding Temple.  I also want to hopefully get a remote position so I can visit other places besides Illinois before I get older.</p>
