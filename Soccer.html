        <p>Another favorite past time of mine is playing soccer. I played when I was younger but I wasn't enthusiastic about it. I was basically forced to be in a bumch of team sports when I was younger by mother to get me out of the house. Eventually I really got hinged on soccer by my own accord and became serious about training and playing in late middle school. I remember watching the pros play in real matches and wanted to be just like them in technical skills and fitness. I grew up on a small dead end street, so I would spend most of my time after school in high school playing and watching tutorials on youtube trying to replicate moves and drills on my own. I never really had any formal training in rec leagues and everything I learned was on my own and through playing pickup with friends.I am a little older now so I'm not as agile and svelt as I used to but I still love playing when I get the opportunity to. I still play on Fridays in an indoor recreational team. </p>
